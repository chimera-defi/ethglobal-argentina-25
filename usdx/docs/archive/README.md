# Archived Documentation

This folder contains archived documentation files that have been consolidated or superseded by newer documents.

## Organization

- **`vercel/`** - Archived Vercel deployment documentation (consolidated into `VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md`)
- **`reviews/`** - Archived review and assessment documents (consolidated into `REVIEW-SUMMARY.md`)
- **`summaries/`** - Archived summary and progress documents

## Current Active Documentation

For current documentation, see:
- **[../README.md](../README.md)** - Main documentation index
- **[../REVIEW-SUMMARY.md](../REVIEW-SUMMARY.md)** - Latest review and status
- **[../VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md](../VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)** - Vercel deployment guide
- **[../BRIDGE-KIT-GUIDE.md](../BRIDGE-KIT-GUIDE.md)** - Bridge Kit integration guide

## Why These Files Are Archived

These files were archived because:
1. **Consolidated** - Merged into single comprehensive guides (e.g., 9 Vercel docs → 1 guide, ~3147 lines → 186 lines)
2. **Duplicate** - Contained repetitive information already covered elsewhere
3. **Outdated** - Superseded by newer documentation (e.g., ARCHITECTURE-REVIEW.md and CRITICAL-GAPS.md from before LayerZero implementation)
4. **Historical** - Interim progress reports that have been completed
5. **Superseded** - Replaced by more current and accurate versions

## Consolidation Results

- **Vercel Documentation**: 9 files (~3147 lines) → 1 file (186 lines) = **94% reduction**
- **Review Documents**: 9 files → 1 file (`REVIEW-SUMMARY.md`)
- **Summary Documents**: 20+ files → Archived (information preserved in active docs)
