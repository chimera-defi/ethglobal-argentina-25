# Archived Layer Zero Documentation

This directory contains historical Layer Zero documentation that has been superseded by current documentation but is preserved for reference.

## Why These Are Archived

These documents served their purpose during research and planning phases but are no longer the primary source of truth. They are kept for historical context and to understand the evolution of the implementation.

## Usage of Archived Docs

These documents can be useful for:
- Understanding the research process
- Historical context
- Decision-making rationale
- Learning how the implementation evolved

However, **always prefer current documentation** for technical accuracy and implementation details.

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when:
1. They've been superseded by better documentation
2. The phase they describe is complete (research → planning → implementation)
3. They contain outdated information
4. They've been consolidated into more comprehensive docs

Archived documents are:
- ✅ Preserved for historical reference
- ✅ Clearly marked as archived
- ✅ Not updated (frozen at archive time)
- ✅ Linked to their replacements
