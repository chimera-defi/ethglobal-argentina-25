# USDX Logo Design Concepts

## Overview

Five professional logo concepts have been created for the USDX Protocol, each emphasizing different aspects of the project's identity: **hub-and-spoke architecture**, **yield generation**, **cross-chain functionality**, and **stability**.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Core Themes
1. **Hub-and-Spoke Architecture** - Central hub (Ethereum) with radiating spokes (L2 chains)
2. **Yield Generation** - Upward arrows symbolizing growth and returns
3. **Stability** - Solid, trustworthy design elements
4. **Cross-Chain** - Interconnected nodes representing multiple blockchains
5. **The "X"** - Brand identity and mathematical precision

### Color Palette
- **Indigo (#4F46E5, #6366F1)** - Primary brand color, trust, technology
- **Emerald (#10B981, #34D399)** - Growth, yield, prosperity
- **Amber (#FBBF24)** - Energy, value, premium quality
- **Navy (#0A0E27)** - Professional background, depth
