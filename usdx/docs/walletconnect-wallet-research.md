# WalletConnect-Compatible Wallets Research
## Desktop Browser Extension + Mobile App Comparison

**Research Date:** 2024  
**Purpose:** Find stable MetaMask alternatives with both desktop browser extensions and mobile apps

---

## Important Note on Desktop-Mobile Sync

**Not all wallets sync between desktop and mobile.** Some wallets offer separate desktop browser extensions and mobile apps that work independently but both support WalletConnect. True sync (where accounts/transactions sync across devices) varies by wallet:
- **Coinbase Wallet**: Separate instances, no automatic sync (but can import same seed phrase)
- **Trust Wallet**: Separate instances, no automatic sync (but can import same seed phrase)
- **Rainbow**: Separate instances, no automatic sync (but can import same seed phrase)
- **MetaMask**: Separate instances, no automatic sync (but can import same seed phrase)

Most wallets allow importing the same seed phrase/recovery phrase on both platforms to access the same accounts, but they don't automatically sync in real-time.
