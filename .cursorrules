# Cursor Rules for USDX Protocol

## Code Quality & Review Standards

### Code Review Requirements
- Always do a thorough multi-pass review before committing
- Remove all unused code, imports, and exports
- Ensure all added code is actually being used
- Minimize code additions - prefer refactoring existing code over adding new code
- Optimize for human readability - code should be clean, understandable, and maintainable

### CSS & Styling Guidelines
- **Maximally reuse Tailwind CSS utilities** instead of adding custom CSS
- Only add custom CSS when absolutely necessary
- Prefer Tailwind's built-in utilities and classes
- Custom CSS should be minimal and well-documented
- Avoid creating custom classes that duplicate Tailwind functionality

### File Organization
- **All generated documentation files must be placed in the `docs/` folder**
- Do not create documentation files in the root directory or other locations
- Generated markdown files, research notes, and documentation should go in `usdx/docs/`
- Keep the repository structure clean and organized

### Code Simplification
- Remove unnecessary abstractions
- Prefer explicit code over clever abstractions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Remove unused exports and imports
- Don't add features "just in case" - only add what's needed

### Git Workflow
- Review all changes before committing
- Ensure commits are focused and meaningful
- Rebase on main/master before creating PRs
- Keep commit messages clear and descriptive

### Self-Assessment Checklist
Before committing, ask:
1. Is all the code I added actually being used?
2. Can I simplify this further?
3. Am I using Tailwind utilities instead of custom CSS?
4. Are there any unused imports or exports?
5. Have I moved all generated docs to the docs folder?
6. Is the code readable and maintainable?
