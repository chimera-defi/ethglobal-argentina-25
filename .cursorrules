# USDX Project Cursor Rules

## Documentation Organization
- **ALWAYS** move generated documentation files (`.md` files) to the `usdx/docs/` folder immediately after creation
- Do not leave documentation files in the root directory or scattered across the project
- Generated docs should be organized by topic in appropriate subdirectories within `usdx/docs/`

## Testing Standards
- **ALWAYS** run tests locally (`forge test`) after making changes to verify everything works
- Fix test failures properly - understand why they fail, don't just remove tests
- When fixing tests:
  - Ensure proper approvals (`approve`) are set up before token transfers
  - Provide ETH for LayerZero fees using `vm.deal(user, amount)` when needed
  - Set up trusted remotes properly for cross-chain tests
  - Use `vm.warp()` to avoid operation ID collisions when testing multiple operations
  - Understand the contract architecture before writing/updating tests

## Code Quality
- Remove unused code and files - don't leave dead code in the codebase
- Ensure all contracts compile without errors
- Use proper error handling and custom errors
- Follow Solidity best practices (checks-effects-interactions pattern, reentrancy guards, etc.)

## LayerZero Integration
- When working with LayerZero:
  - Set trusted remotes for cross-chain communication
  - Provide ETH for LayerZero fees in tests
  - Understand the difference between hub and spoke chain contracts
  - OVault shares are locked in adapters on hub, represented as OFT tokens on spokes

## Review Process
- Do multi-pass reviews of code changes
- Verify all tests pass before considering work complete
- Check that deployment scripts are updated when contract constructors change
- Ensure integration tests cover end-to-end flows

## File Organization
- Contracts go in `usdx/contracts/contracts/`
- Tests go in `usdx/contracts/test/forge/`
- Scripts go in `usdx/contracts/script/`
- Documentation goes in `usdx/docs/`
